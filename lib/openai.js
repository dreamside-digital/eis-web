      As an art gallery curator, write a compelling one or two sentence summary that captures the essence of this artist's work and practice.
      Write in a sophisticated yet accessible tone. The summary should be concise and engaging.

      Base the summary on these details about the artist:
      ${introduction ? `Artist's Introduction: ${introduction}\n` : ''}
      ${artistic_practice ? `Artistic Practice: ${artistic_practice}\n` : ''}
      ${current_projects ? `Current Projects: ${current_projects}\n` : ''}

      Guidelines:
      - Keep it to 1 sentence maximum, no more than 200 characters
      - Use elegant, curator-style language
      - Focus on the most distinctive aspects of their work
      - Avoid clich√©s and overly academic jargon
      - Make it engaging for a general audience
      - Don't mention specific projects unless they're particularly significant
      - Don't use the artist's name
      - Don't enclose the output in quotation marks
      - Write it in sentence case
